# Repository testing

While projects in this repository should each provide its own testing, its various resources also benefit from repository-wide testing, for example Schematron testing to ensure fitness of XProc pipelines and XSpec test files, according to project requirements.

See the explanation on [House Rules](../house-rules.md) for more.

Better, inspect the tests and consider how they are and can be applied.

In time this folder will also provide the 'hub' logic for testing across the repository, under CI/CD.

Schematron files and XProc files may accordingly be used either dynamically and interactively, or applied in batch (scheduled runtimes) as usual.
