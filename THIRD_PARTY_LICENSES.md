# Third party licenses

OSCAL-XProc relies on the open-source software packages [MorganaXProcIII](https://www.xml-project.com/morganaxproc-iiise.html) from [&lt;xml-project />](https://www.xml-project.com) and [Saxon]() from [Saxonica](https://www.saxonica.com/), with their dependencies, including Java.

After installation as described in the [README](README.md), see the `lib` directory for these distributions and their license files.

Licenses bearing on Morgana are in its [licenses](lib/MorganaXProc-IIIse-1.3.7/licences/) folder (GPL3 and other licenses).

Saxon licenses are in the [zip file distribution for Saxon](lib/SaxonHE12-3J.zip) in the `notices` folder - `LICENSE.txt` and neighbor files.

Note that neither of these libraries is available from the project repository; the utility `setup.sh` must be run to acquire them.
