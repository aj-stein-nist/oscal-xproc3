# Contributing to oscal-xproc3

This project began as a spinoff twice removed ([OSCAL Tools](http://pages.nist.gov/oscal-xslt), itself a spinoff). It currently represents work in progress and work always-in-progress. All code is being placed in the public domain in order to make it free to use.

Note that in view of the possibility that it may receive public contributions, and in the hope and expectation that users and contributors all find themselves to be welcome to participate in its development, this site also has a [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## PRs and code

This project welcomes interest from developers (individuals or organizations) who wish to use it as a resource or contribute to it.

The easiest way to contribute to the code base is in a fork under your own control. This can serve as a platform for demonstration as well as development. You can use and benefit from your fork, and decide separately whether to contribute it to this (or any) common codebase.

If you wish to contribute to the common effort, but don't know how to begin, consider learning about testing XSLT (using [XSpec](https://github.com/xspec/xspec)) and contributing tests.

PRs nicely squashed can be accepted into the `main` branch from feature and bugfix branches.

## Issues, feature requests, ideas and bug reports
