# Libraries for OSCAL XProc 3

Downloaded libraries for running the code in this repository are saved in this subdirectory.

Run [../setup.sh](../setup.sh) to save the libraries on your system, with their documentation and licensing information.

See the project [readme](../README.md), the [setup script](../setup.sh) and [setup notes](../setup-notes.md) for details regarding these dependencies.

Expect runtime errors from processing if libraries are missing or named incorrectly. Since scripts including [xp3.sh](../xp3.sh) and [xp3.bat](../xp3.bat) invocation shells use this software, adjustments must be made as software versions, locations or interfaces change.

Refresh by deleteing everything but this file, and run [setup](../setup.sh) again.
